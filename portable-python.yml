folders:
  build: "build/{family}-{version}"   # Allows keeping builds per versions, and inspect them in parallel

# For quick iteration locally, you can add this to your pp-dev.yml:
#folders:
#  sources: dist/sources               # Allows keeping source downloads even after 'rm -rf build'

# If you want to ensure that no non-system lib is referred from libpython.so

# Note: you can also use one argument per line syntax
